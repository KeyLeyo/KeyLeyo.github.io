### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was a very satisfying and insightful lab reguarding the use of If and Else statements. Debugging code during this lab was very fun due to the many rules that each street had to follow. It was a farily simple but fun lab.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 2 was a lab about loops and making a pattern similiar to one you use in knitting. After completing part 1 of this lab part 2 felt simpler and was nice to be able to visualize the loops. Part 2 reminds me of coding on scratch making patterns using loops.

* Lab 6

    Lab 8 part 1 was a lab where we were tasked to find the olympic judge average. This involved loops as well as alot of math. I thought this part was difficult which made it satisfying when we actually got the code to work.
